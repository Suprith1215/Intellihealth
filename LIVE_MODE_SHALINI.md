[You click Live Mode button]

Shalini: "Hi! I'm Shalini, your personal health assistant. 
          I'm here to have a real conversation with you about 
          your recovery journey. Feel free to talk to me naturally, 
          just like you would with a friend. How are you feeling today?"

[Shalini starts listening automatically]

You: "I'm feeling stressed today"

Shalini: "Try the 4-4-4 breathing technique: Inhale for 4 counts, 
          hold for 4, exhale for 4. This activates your parasympathetic 
          nervous system and reduces stress. You're doing great!"

[Shalini starts listening again automatically]

You: "That helps, thank you!"

Shalini: "You're welcome! I'm here whenever you need support. 
          Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?"
