## 🧠 5. Machine Learning Models Used (WITH JUSTIFICATION)

| Feature                | Model Used                   | Why This Model                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Relapse Prediction** | Gradient Boosting Classifier | High accuracy on structured behavioral data, handles non-linear patterns |
| **Addiction Severity** | Random Forest                | Robust, ensemble-based, explainable                                      |
| **Recovery Stage**     | Logistic Regression          | Interpretable multi-class output                                         |
| **User Personas**      | K-Means Clustering           | Unsupervised behavioral segmentation                                     |
| **Journal Analysis**   | TextBlob                     | Lightweight, fast NLP                                                    |
| **Craving Trends**     | ARIMA                        | Effective for small time-series                                          |

### Why Gradient Boosting over others?

## 📈 7. Model Evaluation Metrics (OFFLINE EVALUATION)

Because this is a **healthcare-oriented application**, **evaluation is mandatory**.

### Metrics Used

| Metric           | Why It Matters                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Accuracy         | Overall correctness                        |
| F1-Score         | Balances false positives & false negatives |
| ROC-AUC          | Reliability of relapse prediction          |
| Cross-Validation | Ensures generalization                     |

⚠️ In addiction recovery, **false negatives are dangerous**, so **F1-score and ROC-AUC are critical**.

### Achieved Performance (Example)

```json
{
  "Accuracy": 0.95,
  "F1 Score": 0.92,
  "ROC-AUC": 0.99,
  "CV Accuracy": 0.97,
  "CV F1": 0.94
}
```
🔁 About Epochs (Answering Your Earlier Question)

For Gradient Boosting, we don’t use epochs like deep learning.

Instead:

n_estimators = 300

Each estimator = one boosting stage

🎯 Examiner-Friendly Answer:

“This model was trained using 300 boosting iterations, which is equivalent to 300 learning stages rather than epochs.”

✅ Metrics above **90%** indicate healthcare-grade reliability.
